1.0 You need to create a plan first with parent tasks and children tasks
    and you should ignore all the features which are marked as ***SKIP THIS***,
    please do not cover items which are marked as ***SKIP THIS***, and only cover items where are not marked to be skipped.
2.0 Create a progress tracker in the plan so that we will keep track of the
implementation phase by phase, in case you will doing a particular task
we will know where we left off and what to do next
